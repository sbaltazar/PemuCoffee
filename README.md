# PemuCoffee
An app for coffee lovers


## Getting Started

To get the project working we need and API Key from the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://cloud.google.com/console/google/maps-apis/overview) in your API Settings of your account. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

Add your API Key in the `gradle.properties` file in your project like this:

```
PLACES_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" (with the quotes)
MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY (without the quotes)
```

For the AdMob API the app uses a dummy key for the ads.
